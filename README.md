This simple, responsive website was made to display student projects created at various stages of an immersive 3-month web development course.

The site accomplishes this by storing the project info on Airtable and connecting that database to a Gatsby front end. You can filter the projects by type, and can click through to view the projects, as well as the github repos for each one (when the students supplied them). This required setting up a data table on Airtable, then connecting that information to the site through keys, then figuring out, using graphQL, how the data was organized and how to access the information to be displayed. 

The ability to add new projects is not yet functional, but adding that ability, as well as screen shots from the various projects, is what's up next for this site.
